I am an instructor in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) department at [Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences](https://fens.sabanciuniv.edu/en/), [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/). Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/), [Universite de Paris](https://u-paris.fr/en/), working with [Constantin Enea](https://www.irif.fr/~cenea/) and [Ahmed Bouajjani](https://www.irif.fr/~abou/). I obtained my PhD from [Koc University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), under the supervision of [Serdar Tasiran](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/pioneers/serdar-t).

I am interested in concurrency theory and verification of concurrent programs. My primary focus is on developing deductive verification techniques for shared memory and distributed programs. Currently, I work on understanding and verifying consensus protocols for distributed systems including block chain and cloud computing platforms; developing methods for checking consistency levels of distributed data stores and obtaining space efficient partial order reduction techniques for concurrent programs. I like anything involving refinement proofs.
